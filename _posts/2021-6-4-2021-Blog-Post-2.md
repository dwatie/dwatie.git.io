Learning the programming language R has been interesting thus far. Some things I am understanding and some things things I am having a little more trouble getting the concept. In my previous classes I have been learning the SAS language which seems to be completely different from R. What I like about SAS as opposed to R is that there is a more standdardized way that most programmers use in SAS. So there is a continuity when working with another programmers work. Versus R, there isn't a standardized way becasue there are so many different packages and different ways to program that it is hard to have one standardized way to program. Both languages are maticulous in nature and you have to pay attention to details such as spaces and punctuation. So I wouldn't say one is harder than the other. I do like R because some of the functions that we have gone through this far in the course have been straight forward and I look forward to learning more. I do like the fact that R thinks and does some of the work for you whereas SAS only does what you program it do. As far as it being a difficult language to learn, I feel all languages have their difficulties. Hard or easy is relative to the person that is using the words, so I will say that it does come with it's challenges and that I will need to make sure that I am giving the necessary effort in order to become a proficient programmer in R at the end of the course.
