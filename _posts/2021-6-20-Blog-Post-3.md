This project was probably the most difficult that I have encounter thus far in this class because I am having major challenges setting up the github and connecting the page to the R markdown and pushing the information from R to github. The instructions were confusing to me and I couldn't find videos or examples on the internet that helped me solve the problems. But at this point I have no choice be but to turn it in the way I know how. Other than the difficulties I had managing the github and R, the actual programming didn't go that bad. I was managing to figure a lot of it out and I feel that I am learning R and progressing which is a good thing. However, I still have a long way to go . An interesting find that I have was on the scatter plots that I did, one of them had a relatively linear relationship and the oher had a strong linear relationship. I thought it was interesting seeing there was an actual relationship between variables and seeing normal distributions in the graphs was exciting to me along with the fact that I actaully know what I am looking at was cool to see play out. I haven't been able to see how useful statistics could be in real world practicality until I started taking graduate classes. I look forward to more discovery.
