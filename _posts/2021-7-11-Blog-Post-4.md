The tasks for Project 2 was to take the day.csv, read it in, then split it into a training data set and a testing data set. Then the training was used to create bar plots, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, density plots, and ECDM plots. These plots used various combinations of predictor variable with response variables to give inference and explore the relationship between them. The response variables that were used were casual bike users, registered bike users, and the total count of bike users. After the plots were created, the same training data was used to find the best linear regression model that would be able to use a linear formula for prediction against the testing data set. The RMSE was used as the method to determine which linear model would be best suited for prediction
