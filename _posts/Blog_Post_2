This is my first time learning how to program with R and so far I feel like I am picking it up okay. Some of the language that in the tasks are a little difficult for me to take and convert the tasks to a program. I think that also comes with the challenges of taking an online course just because majority of the time you have to research the answers to the questions you have as opposed to having them answered in class in person. However I am understanding some things more than others. I think that when it comes to SAS, which was the first programming language I have learned, I had some of the same issues when it came down to learning the language. I actually think both languages have its pros and cons. I like SAS because it has a more generalized way of programming that most programmers will understand as for R, there isn't one standard way that everyone programs so you have to take it as it comes. However, I do feel that R is easier to use and isn't as maticulous as SAS is when it comes down to the actual programming piece. I think that learning anything new can be difficult because easy or hard is honestly relative to the person that is using it. I do feel that R has it's challenges, for me personally, but I aslo feel that it has it's share of things that are simple and straightforward which I like. I think the most challenge part of learning the R programming language is not having someone physically with me to show me what I am getting wrong. But that also comes with being a hands on type of learner. Overall I feel like I am learning but I will to work overtime to get up to point I need to where I have to be to be proficient in the language
