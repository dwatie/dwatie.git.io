# My name is: Dionte Watie
## About Me...  
I am originally from San Diego, CA. I am a military kid so I moved around and was fortunate enough to experience different places. I have a Bachelors degree in Mathematics from Winston Salem State University. I am currently pursuing my Masters Degree in Statistics from North Carolina State University.
